# Emulator-Manager

A program that will help manage your emulators, currently supports: 

 - Dolphin
 - Yuzu 

## Features

- Allows you to keep automatic backups of your data 
- Import / Export Data
- Delete all data or just saved data. 
- For yuzu specifically
- - it will automatically prompt you to install the latest firmware and keys to your device when launched*
- - Built-in downloader that allows you to switch firmware and key versions all the way back to 1.0.0

*Requires paths to firmware and keys to be set in settings. This is done by default if you download the -resources-included.exe and requires no further setup.

## How to download 
Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/Viren070/Emulator-Manager/releases/latest)
You can choose either the:
 - Emulator-Manager-resources
 - - Has the required resource files (Installers, firmware, keys)
 - - Much larger file size 
 - Emulator-Manager
 - - does not have the required resource files. 
 - - These must be installed seperately and paths must be set in the settings. 
 - - Has a much smaller file size

- The difference between .exe and .zip is miniscule (.exe may launch a bit faster)
